    -- You don't need to change this function.
    -- Because the inflection table will be added to both A and AP, and this function only lifts A to AP.
    -- We are not modifying the contents of the A in any way, only the type of it.
    -- So "a = a" means: "whatever was in the A, keep it unchanged and lift the type into AP."
    -- This doesn't need to change, as long as A and AP keep having the same lincat.

    -- : AP -> Adv -> AP ;  -- warm by nature
    -- You will need to change this function.
    -- Type signature is AP -> â€¦ -> AP.
    -- Any inflection table that there is, needs to stay as it is.
    -- We are not choosing anything from the inflection table yet, we are only adding new strings to it.
    -- Remember how you did QKind in Foods grammar:
